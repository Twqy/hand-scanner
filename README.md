# hand-scanner
about:
I used OpenCv and MediaPipe to create a real time hand tracker that creates an outline of your hand making connections between your finger joints and finger tips while a hand is detected in the camera

goal:
I was hoping to have a finalized version that would interepet hand signs using a machine learning classifier. I would need to train this model and make it return what it recognizes

This is something im pretty excited to learn about
