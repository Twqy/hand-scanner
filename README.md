# Real-time hand scanner
**About**: <br>
I used OpenCV and MediaPipe to create a real-time hand tracker that creates an outline of your hand making connections between your finger joints and fingertips while a hand is detected in the camera

**Goal**: <br>
I hoped to have a finalized version to interpret hand signs using a machine-learning classifier. I would need to train this model and make it return what it recognizes

This is something I'm pretty excited to learn about
At the moment I have only implemented the hand tracker
